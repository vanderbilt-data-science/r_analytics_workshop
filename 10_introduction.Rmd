# Introductions

Welcome to the Analytics Workshop in R! Most of these lessons are from Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham's R for Data Science (https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html). After the workshop, working through R4DS will a great way to extend your working knowledge. 

In this we'll be introducing both a reproducible process and a language for data analysis. 

## Goals
* Learn a new analytical process
* Understand and use literate programming
* Learn how to practice reproducible research
* Know how find answers and work through problems
* Use R to do all of the above


# Analytics Overview

## Challenges

What are some of the challenges you are facing with your analytics work right now?




## Reproducible Science

See https://scientificbruno.com/rrr/

### Why are we facing this crisis?

*Reproducibility isn’t taught in school

*The incentives in science run counter to spending time on this

*This is changing: Funding agencies are catching on to the problem

### What enables reproducibility?

* What do I need to re-do your experiment?
* Every. Single. Detail.
* Data needs to be shared
* **Methods needs to be detailed and comprehensive**

### Why should I care?
* Moral responsibility as scientists 
* It makes your life easier as a researcher
* You often have to revisit past analyses
* New data
* Realizing a mistake
* Improvements to the methodology
* Your primary collaborator--is yourself 6 months from now, and your past self doesn’t answer emails.

## Version control

Do I need version control even if I am not actively collaborating with others?

A great guide to getting set up with git/GitHub tightly integrated with R is https://happygitwithr.com/. 

## What is tidyverse?

Tidyverse is an collection of libraries extending R, and providing a consistent, functional programming language specifically designed to handle analytical tasks ranging from exploratory data analysis to data wrangling to modeling and production. 

You load tidyverse by a library call in R:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Tidyverse is very well documented, intuitive, and extensible. While you can always solve a problem in R using base R or approaches and packages outside of tidyverse, staying within this set of libraries will simplify your code. 

*TAKE HOME: RStudio and tidyverse are designed to make the analytics workflow simpler, reproducible, and faster.*

# Environment

## Tour of RStudio

Let's take a few minutes to examine the RStudio environment. 

https://www.r-bloggers.com/a-tour-of-rstudio/

## Notebook Basics

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

## Getting Help

In these workshops, you can put up a purple sticky note to get assistance. 

In RStudio, You can use the built-in Help window to look up packages and functions.

Online, you can go to https://www.tidyverse.org/. For example, we'll be talking about functions from the dplyr package. Full documentation is at https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/. It is alway very helpful to look up th vignette associated with a package, if there is one. 



# Workflow: Basics

NOTE: This material can be found in https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-basics.html. 

Before we go any further, let's make sure you've got a solid foundation in running R code, and that you know about some of the most helpful RStudio features.

## Coding basics

Let's review some basics. You can use R as a calculator:

```{r}
1 / 200 * 30
(59 + 73 + 2) / 3
sin(pi / 2)
```

You can create new objects with `<-`:

```{r}
x <- 3 * 4
```

All R statements where you create objects, __assignment__ statements, have the same form:

```{r eval = FALSE}
object_name <- value
```

When reading that code say "object name gets value" in your head.

You will make lots of assignments and `<-` is a pain to type. Don't be lazy and use `=`: it will work, but it will cause confusion later. Instead, use RStudio's keyboard shortcut: Alt + - (the minus sign). Notice that RStudio automagically surrounds `<-` with spaces, which is a good code formatting practice. Code is miserable to read on a good day, so giveyoureyesabreak and use spaces.

## What's in a name?

Object names must start with a letter, and can only contain letters, numbers, `_` and `.`. You want your object names to be descriptive, so you'll need a convention for multiple words. I recommend __snake_case__ where you separate lowercase words with `_`. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
i_use_snake_case
otherPeopleUseCamelCase
some.people.use.periods
And_aFew.People_RENOUNCEconvention
```

We'll come back to code style later, in [functions].

You can inspect an object by typing its name:

```{r}
x
```

Make another assignment:

```{r}
this_is_a_really_long_name <- 2.5
```

To inspect this object, try out RStudio's completion facility: type "this", press TAB, add characters until you have a unique prefix, then press return.

Make yet another assignment:

```{r}
r_rocks <- 2 ^ 3
```

Let's try to inspect it:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
r_rock
#> Error: object 'r_rock' not found
R_rocks
#> Error: object 'R_rocks' not found
```

There's an implied contract between you and R: it will do the tedious computation for you, but in return, you must be completely precise in your instructions. Typos matter. Case matters.

## Calling functions

R has a large collection of built-in functions that are called like this:

```{r eval = FALSE}
function_name(arg1 = val1, arg2 = val2, ...)
```

Let's try using `seq()` which makes regular **seq**uences of numbers and, while we're at it, learn more helpful features of RStudio. Type `se` and hit TAB. A popup shows you possible completions. Specify `seq()` by typing more (a "q") to disambiguate, or by using ↑/↓ arrows to select. Notice the floating tooltip that pops up, reminding you of the function's arguments and purpose. If you want more help, press F1 to get all the details in the help tab in the lower right pane. 

Press TAB once more when you've selected the function you want. RStudio will add matching opening (`(`) and closing (`)`) parentheses for you. Type the arguments `1, 10` and hit return.

```{r}
seq(1, 10)
```

Type this code and notice you get similar assistance with the paired quotation marks:
```{r}
x <- "hello world"
```

Quotation marks and parentheses must always come in a pair. 

Now look at your environment in the upper right pane:

Here you can see all of the objects that you've created.

## Practice

1.  Why does this code not work?
    ```{r, error = TRUE}
    my_variable <- 10
    my_varıable
    ```
    
    Look carefully! (This may seem like an exercise in pointlessness, but
    training your brain to notice even the tiniest difference will pay off
    when programming.)
