What things do you do with data? (Whiteboard)




# Data transformation {#transform}

## Introduction

In this chapter, we'll teach you how to transform your data using the dplyr package and a new dataset on flights departing New York City in 2013.

### Prerequisites

In this chapter we're going to focus on how to use the dplyr package, another core member of the tidyverse. We'll illustrate the key ideas using data from the nycflights13 package. 

```{r setup, message = FALSE}
library(nycflights13)
library(tidyverse)
```

Take careful note of the conflicts message that's printed when you load the tidyverse. 

### nycflights13

To explore the basic data manipulation verbs of dplyr, we'll use `nycflights13::flights`. This data frame contains all 336,776 flights that departed from New York City in 2013. The data comes from the US [Bureau of Transportation Statistics](http://www.transtats.bts.gov/DatabaseInfo.asp?DB_ID=120&Link=0), and is documented in `?flights`.

```{r}

```

You might notice that this data frame prints a little differently from other data frames you might have used in the past: it only shows the first few rows and all the columns that fit on one screen. (To see the whole dataset, you can run `View(flights)` which will open the dataset in the RStudio viewer). It prints differently because it's a __tibble__. Tibbles are data frames, but slightly tweaked to work better in the tidyverse. For now, you don't need to worry about the differences; we'll come back to tibbles in more detail in [wrangle](#wrangle-intro).
 
You might also have noticed the row of three (or four) letter abbreviations under the column names. These describe the type of each variable:

* `int` stands for integers.

* `dbl` stands for doubles, or real numbers.

* `chr` stands for character vectors, or strings.

* `dttm` stands for date-times (a date + a time).

There are three other common types of variables that aren't used in this dataset but you'll encounter later in the book:

* `lgl` stands for logical, vectors that contain only `TRUE` or `FALSE`.

* `fctr` stands for factors, which R uses to represent categorical variables
  with fixed possible values.

* `date` stands for dates.

### dplyr basics

In this chapter you are going to learn the five key dplyr functions that allow you to solve the vast majority of your data manipulation challenges:

* Pick observations by their values (`filter()`).
* Reorder the rows (`arrange()`).
* Pick variables by their names (`select()`).
* Create new variables with functions of existing variables (`mutate()`).
* Collapse many values down to a single summary (`summarise()`).

These can all be used in conjunction with `group_by()` which changes the scope of each function from operating on the entire dataset to operating on it group-by-group. These six functions provide the verbs for a language of data manipulation.

All verbs work similarly: 

1.  The first argument is a data frame.

1.  The subsequent arguments describe what to do with the data frame,
    using the variable names (without quotes).
    
1.  The result is a new data frame.

Together these properties make it easy to chain together multiple simple steps to achieve a complex result. Let's dive in and see how these verbs work.

## Filter rows with `filter()`

`filter()` allows you to subset observations based on their values. The first argument is the name of the data frame. The second and subsequent arguments are the expressions that filter the data frame. For example, we can select all flights on January 1st with:

```{r}

```

When you run that line of code, dplyr executes the filtering operation and returns a new data frame. dplyr functions never modify their inputs, so if you want to save the result, you'll need to use the assignment operator, `<-`:

```{r}

```


*EXERCISE*

Filter out flights for December 12. 

```{r}

```



### Logical operators

Multiple arguments to `filter()` are combined with "and": every expression must be true in order for a row to be included in the output. For other types of combinations, you'll need to use Boolean operators yourself: `&` is "and", `|` is "or", and `!` is "not". Figure \@ref(fig:bool-ops) shows the complete set of Boolean operations.

```{r bool-ops, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Complete set of boolean operations. `x` is the left-hand circle, `y` is the right-hand circle, and the shaded region show which parts each operator selects."}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/transform-logical.png")
```

The following code finds all flights that departed in November or December:

```{r, eval = FALSE}

```

The order of operations doesn't work like English. You can't write `filter(flights, month == 11 | 12)`, which you might literally translate into  "finds all flights that departed in November or December". Instead it finds all months that equal `11 | 12`, an expression that evaluates to `TRUE`. In a numeric context (like here), `TRUE` becomes one, so this finds all flights in January, not November or December. This is quite confusing!

A useful short-hand for this problem is `x %in% y`. This will select every row where `x` is one of the values in `y`. We could use it to rewrite the code above:

```{r, eval = FALSE}

```

Sometimes you can simplify complicated subsetting by remembering De Morgan's law: `!(x & y)` is the same as `!x | !y`, and `!(x | y)` is the same as `!x & !y`. For example, if you wanted to find flights that weren't delayed (on arrival or departure) by more than two hours, you could use either of the following two filters:

```{r, eval = FALSE}

```

As well as `&` and `|`, R also has `&&` and `||`. Don't use them here! You'll learn when you should use them in [conditional execution].


*EXERCISE*

How many flights had arrival delays between one and two hours? 

```{r}

```



**Whenever you start using complicated, multipart expressions in `filter()`, consider making them explicit variables instead. That makes it much easier to check your work. You'll learn how to create new variables shortly.**




### Missing values

One important feature of R that can make comparison tricky are missing values, or `NA`s ("not availables"). `NA` represents an unknown value so missing values are "contagious": almost any operation involving an unknown value will also be unknown.

```{r}

```

The most confusing result is this one:

```{r}

```

It's easiest to understand why this is true with a bit more context:

```{r}
# Let x be Mary's age. We don't know how old she is.
x <- NA

# Let y be John's age. We don't know how old he is.
y <- NA

# Are John and Mary the same age?
x == y
# We don't know!
```

If you want to determine if a value is missing, use `is.na()`:

```{r}

```

`filter()` only includes rows where the condition is `TRUE`; it excludes both `FALSE` and `NA` values. If you want to preserve missing values, ask for them explicitly:

```{r}

```

### Exercises

1.  Find all flights that

    1. Departed in summer (July, August, and September)

```{r}

```
    1. Arrived more than two hours late, but didn't leave late

```{r}

```

    1. Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight
    
    Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight. If a flight was delayed by at least an hour, then dep_delay >= 60. If the flight didn’t make up any time in the air, then its arrival would be delayed by the same amount as its departure, meaning dep_delay == arr_delay, or alternatively, dep_delay - arr_delay == 0. If it makes up over 30 minutes in the air, then the arrival delay must be at least 30 minutes less than the departure delay, which is stated as dep_delay - arr_delay > 30

```{r}


```



    1. Departed between midnight and 6am (inclusive)



```{r}

```


1.  Another useful dplyr filtering helper is `between()`. What does it do?
    Can you use it to simplify the code needed to answer the previous 
    challenges?




1.  How many flights have a missing `dep_time`? What other variables are 
    missing? What might these rows represent?




## Arrange rows with `arrange()`

`arrange()` works similarly to `filter()` except that instead of selecting rows, it changes their order. It takes a data frame and a set of column names (or more complicated expressions) to order by. If you provide more than one column name, each additional column will be used to break ties in the values of preceding columns:

```{r}


```

Use `desc()` to re-order by a column in descending order:

```{r}


```

Missing values are always sorted at the end:


### Exercises

1.  How could you use `arrange()` to sort all missing values to the start?
    (Hint: use `is.na()`).
    
    
1.  Sort `flights` to find the most delayed flights. Find the flights that
    left earliest.
    


1.  Which flights travelled the longest? Which travelled the shortest?


## Select columns with `select()` {#select}

It's not uncommon to get datasets with hundreds or even thousands of variables. In this case, the first challenge is often narrowing in on the variables you're actually interested in. `select()` allows you to rapidly zoom in on a useful subset using operations based on the names of the variables.

`select()` is not terribly useful with the flights data because we only have 19 variables, but you can still get the general idea:

```{r}



```

There are a number of helper functions you can use within `select()`:

* `starts_with("abc")`: matches names that begin with "abc".

* `ends_with("xyz")`: matches names that end with "xyz".

* `contains("ijk")`: matches names that contain "ijk".

* `matches("(.)\\1")`: selects variables that match a regular expression.
   This one matches any variables that contain repeated characters. You'll 
   learn more about regular expressions in [strings].
   
*  `num_range("x", 1:3)`: matches `x1`, `x2` and `x3`.
   
See `?select` for more details.

`select()` can be used to rename variables, but it's rarely useful because it drops all of the variables not explicitly mentioned. Instead, use `rename()`, which is a variant of `select()` that keeps all the variables that aren't explicitly mentioned:

```{r}


```

Another option is to use `select()` in conjunction with the `everything()` helper. This is useful if you have a handful of variables you'd like to move to the start of the data frame.

```{r}


```

### Exercises

1.  What happens if you include the name of a variable multiple times in
    a `select()` call?
    

  

## Add new variables with `mutate()`

Besides selecting sets of existing columns, it's often useful to add new columns that are functions of existing columns. That's the job of `mutate()`. 

`mutate()` always adds new columns at the end of your dataset so we'll start by creating a narrower dataset so we can see the new variables. Remember that when you're in RStudio, the easiest way to see all the columns is `View()`.

```{r}



```

Note that you can refer to columns that you've just created:

```{r}



```




### Useful creation functions {#mutate-funs}

There are many functions for creating new variables that you can use with `mutate()`. The key property is that the function must be vectorised: it must take a vector of values as input, return a vector with the same number of values as output. There's no way to list every possible function that you might use, but here's a selection of functions that are frequently useful:

*   Arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`. These are all vectorised,
    using the so called "recycling rules". If one parameter is shorter than 
    the other, it will be automatically extended to be the same length. This 
    is most useful when one of the arguments is a single number: `air_time / 60`,
    `hours * 60 + minute`, etc.
    
    Arithmetic operators are also useful in conjunction with the aggregate
    functions you'll learn about later. For example, `x / sum(x)` calculates 
    the proportion of a total, and `y - mean(y)` computes the difference from 
    the mean.
    
*   Modular arithmetic: `%/%` (integer division) and `%%` (remainder), where
    `x == y * (x %/% y) + (x %% y)`. Modular arithmetic is a handy tool because 
    it allows you to break integers up into pieces. For example, in the 
    flights dataset, you can compute `hour` and `minute` from `dep_time` with:
    
    ```{r}

    
    ```
  
*   Logs: `log()`, `log2()`, `log10()`. Logarithms are an incredibly useful
    transformation for dealing with data that ranges across multiple orders of
    magnitude. They also convert multiplicative relationships to additive, a
    feature we'll come back to in modelling.
    
    All else being equal, I recommend using `log2()` because it's easy to
    interpret: a difference of 1 on the log scale corresponds to doubling on
    the original scale and a difference of -1 corresponds to halving.

*   Offsets: `lead()` and `lag()` allow you to refer to leading or lagging 
    values. This allows you to compute running differences (e.g. `x - lag(x)`) 
    or find when values change (`x != lag(x)`). They are most useful in 
    conjunction with `group_by()`, which you'll learn about shortly.
    
    ```{r}

    
    ```
  
*   Cumulative and rolling aggregates: R provides functions for running sums,
    products, mins and maxes: `cumsum()`, `cumprod()`, `cummin()`, `cummax()`; 
    and dplyr provides `cummean()` for cumulative means. If you need rolling
    aggregates (i.e. a sum computed over a rolling window), try the RcppRoll
    package.
    
    ```{r}


    ```

*   Logical comparisons, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `!=`, and `==`, which you learned about
    earlier. If you're doing a complex sequence of logical operations it's 
    often a good idea to store the interim values in new variables so you can
    check that each step is working as expected.

*   Ranking: there are a number of ranking functions, but you should 
    start with `min_rank()`. It does the most usual type of ranking 
    (e.g. 1st, 2nd, 2nd, 4th). The default gives smallest values the small
    ranks; use `desc(x)` to give the largest values the smallest ranks. 
    
    ```{r}


    ```
    
    If `min_rank()` doesn't do what you need, look at the variants
    `row_number()`, `dense_rank()`, `percent_rank()`, `cume_dist()`,
    `ntile()`.  See their help pages for more details.
    
    ```{r}


    ```

### Exercises

.  Currently `dep_time` and `sched_dep_time` are convenient to look at, but
    hard to compute with because they're not really continuous numbers. 
    Convert them to a more convenient representation of number of minutes
    since midnight.

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}




```

## Grouped summaries with `summarise()`

The last key verb is summarise(). It collapses a data frame to a single row:

```{r}


```


summarise() is not terribly useful unless we pair it with group_by(). This changes the unit of analysis from the complete dataset to individual groups. Then, when you use the dplyr verbs on a grouped data frame they’ll be automatically applied “by group”. For example, if we applied exactly the same code to a data frame grouped by date, we get the average delay per date:

```{r}


```


Together group_by() and summarise() provide one of the tools that you’ll use most commonly when working with dplyr: grouped summaries. But before we go any further with this, we need to introduce a powerful new idea: the pipe.

## 5.6.1 Combining multiple operations with the pipe

Imagine that we want to explore the relationship between the distance and average delay for each location. Using what you know about dplyr, you might write code like this:

```{r}
by_dest <- group_by(flights, dest)
delay <- summarise(by_dest,
  count = n(),
  dist = mean(distance, na.rm = TRUE),
  delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
)
delay <- filter(delay, count > 20, dest != "HNL")

# It looks like delays increase with distance up to ~750 miles 
# and then decrease. Maybe as flights get longer there's more 
# ability to make up delays in the air?
ggplot(data = delay, mapping = aes(x = dist, y = delay)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = count), alpha = 1/3) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
#> `geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula 'y ~ x'
```


There are three steps to prepare this data:

Group flights by destination.

Summarise to compute distance, average delay, and number of flights.

Filter to remove noisy points and Honolulu airport, which is almost twice as far away as the next closest airport.

This code is a little frustrating to write because we have to give each intermediate data frame a name, even though we don’t care about it. Naming things is hard, so this slows down our analysis.

There’s another way to tackle the same problem with the pipe, %>%:

```{r}


delays <- flights %>% 
  group_by(dest) %>% 
  summarise(
    count = n(),
    dist = mean(distance, na.rm = TRUE),
    delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>% 
  filter(count > 20, dest != "HNL")
```


This focuses on the transformations, not what’s being transformed, which makes the code easier to read. You can read it as a series of imperative statements: group, then summarise, then filter. As suggested by this reading, a good way to pronounce %>% when reading code is “then”.

Behind the scenes, x %>% f(y) turns into f(x, y), and x %>% f(y) %>% g(z) turns into g(f(x, y), z) and so on. You can use the pipe to rewrite multiple operations in a way that you can read left-to-right, top-to-bottom. We’ll use piping frequently from now on because it considerably improves the readability of code, and we’ll come back to it in more detail in pipes.

Working with the pipe is one of the key criteria for belonging to the tidyverse. The only exception is ggplot2: it was written before the pipe was discovered. Unfortunately, the next iteration of ggplot2, ggvis, which does use the pipe, isn’t quite ready for prime time yet.
